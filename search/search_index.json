He wants to go ahead with his friend [[Sildar Hallwinter]] ('cause they thought why not) so they hired us. The contents of the wagon are: 12 sacks of flour, 4 casts of salted pork, 2 kegs of strong ale, 12 shovels/picks/crowbars/etc, 5 lanterns, and a small barrel of oil (50 flasks worth). It is around 100gp worth. Our job is to escort this wagon from the city of [[Neverwinter]] where he gathered us to the frontier town out in the east called Phandalin. Used to be a thriving mining town, but isn't any more. Cart pulled by oxen. We get a reward for escorting this thing, we'll be given about 10gp each. We're about a few hours from our destination.</p> <p>Grace: is there law enforcement? Percy: there's a mayor running the town etc.</p>"},{"location":"2023-03-02/#the-journey-begins","title":"The journey begins","text":"<p>Early-mid afternoon, spring. We turn round a bend and... two dead horses sprawled about 50ft ahead, blocking the path. Each has black-feathered arrows sticking out of them. We recognise the horses - they are the horses that Gundren and Sildar ventured out on originally. The saddlebags have been looted. An empty leather map case has been strewn nearby.</p> <p>From the thickets, two goblins appear! Combat. They slice through Balthazar's hip and drop him to 2hp. We hear an arrow whistling... He full heals with Cure Wounds. Caebrek uses warhammer to thwack one of the goblins round the head; he crumples down to the ground, unconscious. Rae pierces the other goblin's side and he falls. The other goblin seems to run away to the north.</p> <p>Rae starts walking away, \"everything is fine...everything is..\\&lt;grunt&gt;fine...\" Balthazar comes after. Caebrek takes some rope and binds the unconscious goblins up and puts them in the sacks that contained flour. Had to cut the rope into 10ft + 10ft + 30ft remaining chunks. Balthazar runs to the cart, empties another sack of flour, and comes back to Rae. He wraps her wound in the sack, stemming the bleeding. Balthazar helps Caebrek pick up the goblins and put them in the wagon. Caebrek halves the remaining 30ft rope (Balthazar gives a stare like \"do not cut any more of this damn rope\"). They use the remaining rope to try to move the horses off the path...they fail their athletics checks and Rae just suggests to use the oxen to move the horses instead after watching them fail miserably. Balthazar unties the oxen to the cart and attaches them to the horses, and they start to slowly pull them to the embankment off the side of the road.</p> <p>We start the trek toward Phandalin again. The goblins wake up. Caebrek puts a dagger to one of the goblins and \"interviews\" them. Caebrek cuts the neck of one of the goblins, causing him to fall unconscious, then casts Spare the Dying. Light is dimming. The remaining goblin is tired of life, mainly; mistreated in life. After the goblin refuses to give up any information, Caebrek gets out warhammer and thwacks him in the head, killing him instantly. The goblin is then thrown over the side of the cart.</p>"},{"location":"2023-03-02/#arriving-at-phandalin","title":"Arriving at Phandalin","text":"<p>Lights come up in the distance, a few dots from a couple of houses on the outskirts of the town. We arrive in town along the Triboar Trail. Need to drop wagon off at Phandalin#Barthen's Provisions. The goblin that's still alive was the one that Raewyll stabbed. The constant reminder that she stabbed someone keeps playing on her mind.</p> <p>Caebrek casts Disguise Self to turn themselves into Balthazar, and walks to Barthen's Provisions. \"Open 7am-6pm. Recommended: go to the Stonehill Inn if arriving later.\" It's a fairly normal-looking tavern, not run-down, not posh. 6-7 tables, some booths, people sitting around drinking, chatting, a barkeep behind the bar. Caebrek goes to the barkeep, who looks a little wary (given that Balthazar's form has no skin). Barkeep suggests to talk to Barthen to learn more about Gundren. He suggests that they take a drink and go to bed for the night.</p> <p>Caebrek buys a tankard of ale, and starts talking to someone called Narth, who is reading a book. Also talks to a dwarf and asks him where one could find a dragon in these parts. He says to talk to Quelline, who lives in/near a farm. His expertise is in mining. Caebrek also talks to someone who says Barthen never stops going on about Gundren Rockseeker. Gossip from this person: </p> <p>Apparently, Daran Edermath went on all these quests, doesn't talk to people, just sits in his orchard. A bit odd, like ancient...I think he's a half-elf? He really should be dead but he's not. Like 180 years old?</p> <p>Everyone in the town is quite friendly, but the Redbrands - people wouldn't be sad if they're gone. They normally inhabit the Sleeping Giant. They keep raiding stores...my mother has a story for you if you want to know about them.</p> <p>Caebrek returns to the cart. Balthazar is humming and Rae is playing the ukulele along to it. Caebrek goes to the goblin - the music stops. \"How old was your companion?\" He (apparently) doesn't know. We all go to sleep in the back of the wagon.</p>"},{"location":"2023-03-18/","title":"2023 03 18","text":""},{"location":"2023-03-18/#barthens-provisions","title":"Barthen's Provisions","text":"<p>We wake up in the back of the wagon. Rae and Balthazar walk to Stonehill Inn. Order some food. Balthazar asks if tavernkeep has seen Barthen yet, he hasn't yet, but his shop Phandalin#Barthen's Provisions should be open.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Caebrek checks to see if the remaining goblin is actually still alive - he's stable but very asleep. Upon learning this information, the natural decision was to punch the goblin awake. Goblin awakens and screams. This goblin is named Wart. Caebrek says that he'll remove the goblin's arm if he doesn't tell him who sent them. Reveals: the goblins live in a cave (he just follows other people, doesn't know exact location). The superior is called Klarg but is annoying; the rest of them want Yeemick to be in charge but he's also a bit of a bitch. Klarg gets orders from some place - Cragmar castle? They goblins are in the Cragmar hideout. Experienced multiple winters, so been in there multiple years. One can through the woods to find the cave. Caebrek threatens to remove Wart's arm anyway. Raewyll returns, screams at the horror unfolding, and separates the two in exchange for giving them the food.</p> <p>Stuff has been eaten and drunk. We go to Barthen's Provisions. Caebrek immediately orders a Bee Revival Kit for 1sp. We tell Barthen that Gundren's horses have perished. Gundren was supposed to arrive a day ago but he's not here...Barthen is worried. Barthen thinks it was the goblins. Barthen wants us to find out what happened to him, and the people employed to transport the wagon (us!). Caebrek is trying to persuade Barthen that we're not those people, saying instead we're his friends. Raewyll is trying to look like not associated with the other two. She buys 50ft rope (for 6sp not the normal 1gp because she looks trustworthy!) and exits immediately. Caebrek tries to sell Barthen the items that were on the wagon. Balthazar and Caebrek majestically fail their persuasion checks, and Barthen realises. Rae overhears and re-enters; Balthazar yoinks Rae's rope in an attempt to tie up Barthen.</p> <p>A witness comes in. Rae talks to Barthen and reveals our employer, indicates she doesn't want to stay with the rest of the party and therefore basically betrays them and says the others want to fleece him. We eventually persuade him that we're tentatively ok to trust...ish. Barthen wants us to investigate Gundren and the Redbrands in exchange for some money.</p> <p>Linene, at the Lionsshield Coster, deals in shields and armour and that sort of thing; she only sells to people who are trustworthy. Quelline knows a lot about plants and herbs (Caebrek wants poison).</p>"},{"location":"2023-03-18/#the-escape-of-wart","title":"The Escape of Wart","text":"<p>There is no goblin in the cart any more. In the dirt path are splotches of something that jumped off the wagon, fell over, and continued down the road... Wart is gone!</p> <p>There is no blood in the wagon. Caebrek and Balthazar take a small amount of the pork and ale for the future journey. Balthazar and Raewyll lead the oxen and cart to Barthen's Provisions. Raewyll tells Barthen that Gundren originally offered 15gp but she suggests 10gp for his troubles. He accepts (for Raewyll) giving her 15gp and the others 10gp because they were more troublesome. Raewyll and Barthen leave amicably.</p> <p>Caebrek and Balthazar go to the Stonehill Inn, ask for Quelline. Someone says she's going to be at Phandalin#Alderleaf Farm. They go there and find a little cottage and a bunch of fields with wheat, carrots etc, and a barn at the back. Caebrek denies Balthazar the opportunity to suckle on the teat of the cow at the farm. They knock on the cottage door. A halfling woman opens the door. Quelline invites them in for tea (no ale in her house). The goblins have apparently been plaguing the merchants, and the Redbrands have been terrible to everyone. The townmaster won't do anything about it, no backbone in that man! A druid friend called Reidoth lives in the ruins of Thundertree who knows more about herbal things than she does. Reidoth also knows about a dragon! She also says that the goblins are tricksters and lay traps, and no-one knows where they are. Caebrek loves the tea (both the physical and metaphorical).</p> <p>Raewyll goes to the Lionshield Coster to get weapons. She buys a handaxe. Linene indicates she'd give money for adventurers to take out the goblins.</p>"},{"location":"2023-03-18/#the-goblin-cave","title":"The goblin cave","text":"<p>There are sack-prints (and the occasional face-print) down the path. The path eventually does a U-turn and then goes into the thickets, there's an opening that Wart has clearly ploughed through. Balthazar leads, then Caebrek, then Rae - Balthazar tries to track. There's been downtrodden sticks that we can follow. We're ready to fight if we need to. Balthazar offers the black-tipped arrows, they don't look poisoned or anything, they are sharp enough to use. There are some suspicious leaves, could be a trap! Balthazar guides us around a couple of traps.</p> <p>We come to the mouth of a cave. Our loud noises alert something in the bushes - two arrows come whizzing out. We run into the cave. Inside is a stream and a pathway. Up ahead is a bridge over the stream. To the right are steps leading up to another room, and just before the bridge is somewhere going off to the left. Caebrek manages to intimidate the lookout goblins into returning to their post.</p> <p>We go to the right, and Balthazar produces a small flame to be able to see. Small dank chamber, filled with the stench of animals. 3 wolves chained up to an iron rode driven into the base of a stalagmite. There's a fissure going upwards. Caebrek manages to climb up it, and finds sacks and crates of looted provisions...and Klarg the bugbear! Caebrek talks to Klarg (who is understandably confused), and falls back down the fissure taking lots of damage. The wolves wake up, and we skirt around them out of the room. The lookout goblins come back in as they think we're a threat again due to the howling of the wolves. Fight begins. Raewyll instakills a goblin attacking Balthazar with sneak attack. Caebrek uses the warhammer to kill the other goblin - they're both dead.</p> <p>In the path to the left, there's rubble as if there's been a cave-in. There's a ledge, not much here. This passage isn't really used.</p> <p>Towards the bridge, there's a stream coming down the left and a waterfall bit on the right. Above, there is a bridge going across, connecting a passageway on the left to one on the right. We continue forwards, under the bridge. Raewyll notices a goblin on the left hand side of the bridge peeking around. Before we can escape, they chuck a javelin at Balthazar and it punctures his spleen. We then round the corner.</p> <p>Two other goblins remove some stones from the edge of a pool of water, causing it to gush down the cavern we were just in. Raewyll shoves one of them into the water, causing it to get flushed away down the stream. Caebrek whacks the other goblin with the warhammer. Rae then stabs the goblin with a dagger and its lifeless body floats down the stream. The goblin from the bridge gets to us, Rae stabs and Caebrek finishes it off.</p> <p>We go back the other way to go up to the bridge, we cross it and follow the path. There is a large area with three goblins around a fire, with some steps up to a higher level. There's a human man tied up against a rock, quite badly wounded. Raewyll tries to covertly shoot one of the goblins with the bow, but it misses. Fight breaks out; Raewyll and Balthazar are knocked unconscious.</p> <p>One of the goblins then calls a truce, otherwise the human dies. They also say that if we kill Klarg, they won't kill us. The goblin says the human is called Sildar. Apparently Gundren was taken back to the \"big bit\", i.e. the castle. Caebrek casts spare the dying on Rae and Balthazar. We take a long rest inside the cave so that we can heal up to deal with Klarg.</p>"},{"location":"2023-03-18/#onwards-to-klarg","title":"Onwards, to Klarg","text":"<p>We go towards Klarg's lair. Balthazar, being very \"popular with the Klargs\", attempts to flirt with Klarg. He flutters his lower eyelids (which he has) at Klarg, tells him that a friend said he is very attractive, and offers to watch the waterfalls together.</p> <p>Klarg - Klarg thoughts? Your friend, mirage. Your friend does not exist. Klarg better than you. Klarg knows more. Klarg hotter. Klarg out of your league. Klarg going to be mighty warlord. You, just peasant. You odd creature from the depths of hell. You do not deserve Klarg's love.</p> <p>Klarg</p> <p>Balthazar weeps and goes down the steps. Klarg feels pleased with this outcome. Raewyll gives a dagger to each of the others, and they surprise Klarg by simultaneously throwing the daggers as Rae shoots the shortbow. Caebrek smashes in the pet wolf's head with a warhammer. Balthazar is downed twice. Klarg is killed by Caebrek's opportunity attack. Caebrek sings the \"Klarg's in a heap\" song. The loot contains emblems of a lion on a shield - Raewyll has seen this insignia before, the sign outside the weapons shop. Rae assumes that this loot contains the stolen shipment of shields. There's a crate with its lid slightly ajar, inside is a treasure chest. Inside is a piece of paper saying \"this is Klarg's, keep out\". There are 600cp, 110sp, 2 potions of healing, and a little jade statuette of a frog with gold eyes.</p> <p>Caebrek and Rae carry Balthazar back into the room with the goblins. Rae says \"We have killed Klarg\", and proves it by pulling out the \"this is Klarg's, keep out\" paper from her pack. Rae gives the frog statuette to the goblin in exchange for Sildar. Rae cuts through the rope and frees Sildar. The whereabouts of Wart are, at this point, unknown.</p> <p>Sildar joined the Griffin Cavalry of Waterdeep, and has been an agent of the Lord's Alliance ever since. About 5 years ago, he met a strange small fellow who seemed to want help looking for a mine. His name was Gundren Rockseeker. Met him in [[Neverwinter]], and he recently asked him to join on a quest, as Gundren found the map to the mine they were looking for. He has his own reasons to be in Phandalin, so agreed to join in the trek. Another friend, Iarno Albrek, was a member of the Lord's Alliance; he disappeared a while back when he went to Phandalin. Wants to find him. Klarg is certainly not the leader. Perhaps, the black spider who gave him orders from Cragmar Castle is the real leader. He fears that it was on this spider's orders that he and Gundren were attacked. They must have taken the map that Gundren had. He has no idea where the castle is. Sildar introduces The Lost Mine.</p> <p>Balthazar awakens.

Over 500 years ago, some dwarves and gnomes made a pact called the Phandelver's Pact, which allowed them to share in the bountiful riches that they could get from the Wave Echo Cave, which they could share between the two races. Later, the humans also entered into this pact to help channel the magic from this cave, to form spells and create magical items. The humans lived in Phandalin, a sprawling town at its height, but the orcs and wizards attacked. The mine was attacked and destroyed its entrances. Gundren feels that the map that he found is the map to the cave, and I really hope it is. Since then, Phandelin has resettled, but it is not what it once was. Gundren told me that he and his two brothers found the cave entrance and want to reopen it - I'm not sure if they ended up following the map or they have yet to.
