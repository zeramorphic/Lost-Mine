## Barthen's Provisions
We wake up in the back of the wagon. Rae and Balthazar walk to Stonehill Inn. Order some food. Balthazar asks if tavernkeep has seen Barthen yet, he hasn't yet, but his shop [[Phandalin#Barthen's Provisions]] should be open.

Meanwhile, Caebrek checks to see if the remaining goblin is actually still alive - he's stable but very asleep. Upon learning this information, the natural decision was to punch the goblin awake. Goblin awakens and screams. This goblin is named Wart. Caebrek says that he'll remove the goblin's arm if he doesn't tell him who sent them. Reveals: the goblins live in a cave (he just follows other people, doesn't know exact location). The superior is called Klarg but is annoying; the rest of them want Yeemick to be in charge but he's also a bit of a bitch. Klarg gets orders from some place - Cragmar castle? They goblins are in the Cragmar hideout. Experienced multiple winters, so been in there multiple years. One can through the woods to find the cave. Caebrek threatens to remove Wart's arm anyway. Raewyll returns and says "what thE FUCK ARE YOU DOING", separates the two in exchange for giving them the food.

Stuff has been eaten and drunk. We go to Barthen's Provisions. Caebrek immediately orders a Bee Revival Kit for 1sp. We tell Barthen that Gundren's horses have perished. Gundren was supposed to arrive a day ago but he's not here...Barthen is worried. Barthen thinks it was the goblins. Barthen wants us to find out what happened to him, and the people employed to transport the wagon (us!). Caebrek is trying to persuade Barthen that we're not those people, saying instead we're his friends. Raewyll is trying to look like not associated with the other two. She buys 50ft rope (for 6sp not the normal 1gp because she looks trustworthy!) and exits immediately. Caebrek tries to sell Barthen the items that were on the wagon. Balthazar and Caebrek majestically fail their persuasion checks, and Barthen realises. Rae overhears and re-enters; Balthazar yoinks Rae's rope in an attempt to tie up Barthen.

A witness comes in. Rae talks to Barthen and reveals our employer, indicates she doesn't want to stay with the rest of the party and therefore basically betrays them and says the others want to fleece him. We eventually persuade him that we're tentatively ok to trust...ish. Barthen wants us to investigate [[Gundren Rockseeker|Gundren]] and the [[Redbrands]] in exchange for some money.

Linene, at the Lionsshield Coster, deals in shields and armour and that sort of thing; she only sells to people who are trustworthy. Quelline knows a lot about plants and herbs (Caebrek wants poison).

## The Escape of Wart
There is no goblin in the cart any more. In the dirt path are splotches of something that jumped off the wagon, fell over, and continued down the road... Wart is gone!

There is no blood in the wagon. Caebrek and Balthazar take a small amount of the pork and ale for the future journey. Balthazar and Raewyll lead the oxen and cart to Barthen's Provisions. Raewyll tells Barthen that Gundren originally offered 15gp but she suggests 10gp for his troubles. He accepts (for Raewyll) giving her 15gp and the others 10gp because they were more troublesome. Raewyll and Barthen leave amicably.

Caebrek and Balthazar go to the Stonehill Inn, ask for Quelline. Someone says she's going to be at [[Phandalin#Alderleaf Farm]]. They go there and find a little cottage and a bunch of fields with wheat, carrots etc, and a barn at the back. Caebrek denies Balthazar the opportunity to suckle on the teat of the cow at the farm. They knock on the cottage door. A halfling woman opens the door. Quelline invites them in for tea (no ale in her house). The goblins have apparently been plaguing the merchants, and the Redbrands have been terrible to everyone. The townmaster won't do anything about it, no backbone in that man! A druid friend called Reidoth lives in the ruins of Thundertree who knows more about herbal things than she does. Reidoth also knows about a dragon! She also says that the goblins are tricksters and lay traps, and no-one knows where they are. Caebrek loves the tea (both the physical and metaphorical).

Raewyll goes to the Lionshield Coster to get weapons. She buys a handaxe. Linene indicates she'd give money for adventurers to take out the goblins.
