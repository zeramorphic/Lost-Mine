> Gundren told me this a while ago. Over 500 years ago, some dwarves and gnomes made a pact called the Phandelver's Pact, which allowed them to share in the bountiful riches that they could get from the Wave Echo Cave, which they could share between the two races. Later, the humans also entered into this pact to help channel the magic from this cave, to form spells and create magical items. The humans lived in Phandalin, a sprawling town at its height, but the orcs and wizards attacked. The mine was attacked and destroyed its entrances. Gundren feels that the map that he found is the map to the cave, and I really hope it is. Since then, Phandelin has resettled, but it is not what it once was. Gundren told me that he and his two brothers found the cave entrance and want to reopen it - I'm not sure if they ended up following the map or they have yet to. The black spider wanted to take it for themselves. And this brings us to the present.
